Excluding the File read from Worst case Big O notation in all task

Task0
Worst Case O(0n + 2)
Explanation: The number of input has no effect on the commands executed. a total of two lines to print the result will
be executed anytime the program runs

Task1
Worse Case O(6n + 2)
Explanation: The two loops have 3 lines to run for each input making it 3n for each loop which becomes 6n for the two
loops. creation of the variable to store values and printing the result represent the +2 as they are not affected by
change in input

Task2
Worse Case O(11n + 3)
Explanation: A total of 11 lines must be executed for the loop to complete each cycle making it 11n. the two variable
creating and printing the result make up the +3 as they will not be changed when there is a change in input

Task3
Worse Case O (11n + 8)
Explanation: A total of 7 lines must be executed for the loop to complete a cycle but two these lines are calls to a
function which has O(3n) as its worse case. substituting each line results in 11n. The +8 consist of various operations
and printing of result that don't change with input change

Task4
Worse Case O(6n + 6)
Explanation: he two loops have 3 lines to run for each input making it 3n for each loop which becomes 6n for the two
loops. Other operations make up for the +6
